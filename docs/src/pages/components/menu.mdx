# Menu

## Usage

- Menus are typically used when you have 5-15 items to choose from. They're used for navigation or commands, where an action is initiated based on the selection.
- When organizing menu items, sort the list in a logical order by putting the most selected option at the top
- Use for a “more” menu, where the control contains an icon or button
- Use for user profiles, where the control is an avatar
- Try to keep MenuItems content to single line. If text are truncated, it's advised to include a way to display the hidden content (hover, click, etc.)

## Guidelines

### Menu items should be always written in sentence case, not title case

The first word should be capitalized and the rest lowercase (unless a proper noun):

- Correct: Create user
- Incorrect: Create User

### Menu items should always lead with a strong verb that encourages action

Use the `{verb}`+`{noun}` format except in the case of common actions like Save, Close or Cancel.

- Correct: Edit row
- Incorrect: Editing options

### Avoid unnecessary words and articles in items, such as “the”, “an” or “a”

- Correct: Change theme
- Incorrect: Change the theme

### Avoid ending item in punctuation

- Correct: Switch user
- Incorrect: Switch user.

### Avoid all caps for items

- Correct: Switch user
- Incorrect: SWITCH USER

### Don't

- Don't use for form inputs or selects, use the Select or Input instead
- Don't use for hiding primary actions since they should be visible by default
- Don't nest elements or components other than the MenuItem and MenuGroup components
