# Popover

## Usage

- Always position popover next to the button or other interface element that toggles it
- Use a popover to contain controls or information that doesn't need to be shown immediately
- Use a popover to contain items that will most likely not fit into the current view
- Use a clearly labelled button to reveal the popover
- Use the appropriate aria-haspopup and role attributes for both the toggle button and containing items. Please refer to the [MDN documentation on both role values](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-haspopup#values) and [child role values](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-haspopup#values)

## Guidelines

### If a popover contains actions, they should be always written in sentence case, not title case

The first word should be capitalized and the rest lowercase (unless a proper noun)

- Correct: Create user
- Incorrect: Create User

# Popover actions should always lead with a strong verb that encourages action

Use the `{verb}`+`{noun}` format except in the case of common actions like Save, Close or Cancel.

- Correct: Edit row
- Incorrect: Editing options

### Avoid unnecessary words and articles in items, such as “the”, “an” or “a”

- Correct: Change theme
- Incorrect: Change the theme

### Avoid ending item in punctuation

- Correct: Switch user
- Incorrect: Switch user.

### Avoid all caps for popover actions

- Correct: Switch user
- Incorrect: SWITCH USER

### Avoid using horizontal displayed components (eg. List) inside PopoverItem, as it may not display correctly for mobile

### Don't

- Don't hide information inside a popover that is imperative to using the current view
- Don't obscure other controls that are important with the popover
- Don't allow the popover to be obscured by other controls or the outer bounds of the current view

## Issues

1. This issue is the same as in Menu. Read more [here](https://github.com/radix-ui/primitives/issues/1522).

<b>Description</b>: Opening the popover will make the page scroll to the place
that it portals to. If the portal destination is document.body, the page will
scroll to the end (where the portal is). It should have scrolled to the position
of the PopoverTrigger instead, but there has been no proper way to do it yet.

There is a walk around for it. However, please remember to remove any autofocus from children of PopoverContent, because it will override the current walk around.

2. Currently, Popover only animates correctly if the side of the PopoverContent is bottom. This should be done in next updates for it.
